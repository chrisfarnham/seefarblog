Personal site for Chris Farnham, W1YTQ. Where I share my adventures in radio, the outdoors
and technology.

Site visitors may want to go to my
summarizing page, [Journal Entry Rollup]({% link _sections/Journal_Entry_Rollup.md %}) where
I summarize and categorize the entries I've written (so far) for this site.
As of Spring of 2025 I've written over forty different entries where I
share and explore aspects of radio I enjoy.

## My Reverse Beacon Network activity

The [Reverse Beacon Network](https://www.reversebeacon.net/main.php) is a worldwide network
of stations listening to the airwaves and reporting what stations they hear, when and how well. When I'm operating my radio
in CW mode (Morse Code) RBN stations will decode my call sign (W1YTQ) and report it back to the network. If I have internet access,
I can use the RBN check where my signal is being received and its strength (in decibels).

The RBN database can be queried to show my radio activity over time (see below).
