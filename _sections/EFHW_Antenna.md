# New End-Fed Half-Wave Antenna

This past weekend (9/17/2023) I finally went ahead and constructed 
a new end-fed half-wave (EFHW) antenna. All
my previous radio work was with the 
[end-fed random wire](https://udel.edu/~mm/ham/randomWire/) (EFRW) antenna. I wanted to experiment
and try out something resonant. I went with an end-fed because it's easy to setup with the
one tree on my 0.8 acre property.

End-fed antennas are pretty easy to construct. I built it exactly as instructed in
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcuHTWWOg7c), 
"HF Back-Yard Secret - A Budget Class Antenna System." I used the same transformer
that's shown in the video, an [LDG 49-1 Unun](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/ldg-ru-49-1).

I cut the EFHW to 33 feet for the 20 meter band. If I doubled the length, then the antenna
would work well for the 40 meter band. My yard might be able to fit a 66 foot antenna but not easily.
After learning and working with this one I can easily get some more wire and build another one.

## How well does my EFHW work? 

In a Fediverse conversation [megahertz@mastodon.radio](https://mastodon.radio/@megahertz) said, "2 observations for me in working with both types of antennas is: (1) With the EFRW I could tune all but 40m and I think 15m or something, but it did work and it tuned on all other ham bands. After trying things like changing the length of the wire without success I had to revert to using an external tuner.  The EFHW will tune in most bands (that I use) with the built in rig (7300) tuner. (2)  The EFRW has a bit more noise."

That has been my observation so far as well. I really liked how the random wire antenna allowed me to 
use any band. My Xeigu G90 has a great built-in antenna tuner. I had no issues on any band. But I was 
losing power because it was non-resonant.

Global radio propagation has been really poor lately due to solar storms. But last night I was hearing
multiple California radio stations. I'd never had a contact that far west.

With only 20 watts of power I was able to confirm a two-way contact with 
[N6YYO](https://www.qrz.com/db/N6YYO) in Huntington Beach, CA on 20 meters. He had a really good directional antenna and was really patient as I repeated W1YTQ, my call sign, several times before
he could confirm it. But contact was made nonetheless. 

It's all anecdotal but I'm pretty pleased with the antenna so far. I think the big lesson isn't that
