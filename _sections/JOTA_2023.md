# Jamboree on the Air 2023

[Jamboree on the Air (JOTA)](https://www.scout.org/news/jota-joti-2023) is an annual event where Scouts across the world meet together on
the air and the internet for a virtual jamboree.

During the JOTA event my son's Scout Troop was camping at nearby [Camp Resolute](https://www.mayflowerbsa.org/camping/camp-resolute/about/)
in Bolton, MA. [Troop 119, Lexington](http://www.troop119.com/) is fortunate to have a handful of adults and Scouts with amateur
radio licenses. One of our Scouts invited members of his radio club, [Sci-Tech Amateur Radio Society](https://www.ne1ar.org/stars/) so
we had three different stations operating on 17, 20 and 40 meters.

I set up my Xiegu G90 on 20 meters. Throughout the day, Scouts came by to learn about radio and get on the air with me. The bands
were open. JOTA, [POTA's Support Your Parks event](https://pota.app/#/events) and 
the [New York QSO Party](https://nediv.arrl.org/2023/10/10/new-york-qso-party-october-21-22-2023/) were all happening on the same
days so there were a lot operators on the air.

> Three events! JOTA, POTA's Support Your Parks and the New York QSO Party were all happening on the same day.

I worked single-side-band most of the day with Scouts. As Scouts came by I'd
answer questions and explain some basic radio and RF propagation concepts. 
They learned enough radio operating terms and etiquette to talk on the air.
As you can see, it was pouring rain all day. The rain made setup a little more challenging but
the Scouts were in good spirits and participated enthusiastically.

Our troop will be offering Radio and Electronic Merit Badges soon as a two-for-one class. From the turnout last weekend
I expect broad participation and am looking forward to it.
