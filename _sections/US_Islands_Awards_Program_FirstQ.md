# US Islands Awards Program recognizes Scouts from Troop 119 Lexington

Last week, on March 13, 2025, two Scouts from [Troop 119 Lexington](https://www.troop119.com/) were recognized by
the [US Islands Awards Program](https://usislands.org/) for being the first to qualify Peddocks Island in Boston Harbor.

USI is an amateur radio award program centered around chasing and activating river, lake, and ocean shore islands within the 50 United States and its Territories and Protectorates.[^1]

In September 2024  our Scout Troop went camping on Peddocks Island. We set up a radio station and two Scouts with 
amateur radio call signs, K1MKD and KC1UHS, spent part of their day making radio contacts. After 
sharing [our radio adventures on Peddocks Island on this site]({% link _sections/POTA_Paddocks_Island.md %}), 
the US Islands on the Air
Awards Manager, NS4J, reached out to let me know that we could complete a "USI Island Qualification Form" to be recognized
by the program as being the first to qualify Peddocks Island.

Here is a photo of the Scouts receiving their awards at our Troop's Court of Honor.[^2]

I'd like to thank NS4Jay and the US Islands Awards Program for reaching out and recognizing two of our
Scouts for their interest in and participation in amateur radio.
