These are my goals for 2024

   - Improve my antenna; get something that works for 40 meters
 - Activate a park for POTA using CW only
 - Operate in Canada
 - Do a summits on the air (SOTA) activation


## 2023 retrospective of my radio activities

This time last year I wrote a journal entry listing my goals in the amateur radio hobby for 2023. For the most
part, I accomplished all of the goals I wrote down and more.

Highlights for 2023 were [activating my first park]({% link _sections/First_POTA_Activation.md %}) and my 
[first CW QSO]({% link _sections/First_Morse_Code_Contact.md %}).

Here's a map of my North American contacts for 2023
