# Last week I made my first confirmed contact using Morse code (CW)

One of my goals when returning to amateur radio after a long break was to learn
Morse code so that I could operate in CW. CW stands for continuous wave. CW is 
how amateur radio operator refer to morse code operation because each dot or dash
sent is an unbroken, Continuous Wave.

CW operation is incredibly efficient in terms of power used and signal propagation.
In CW mode, each dot or dash sent is at maximum
power and exists within a narrow band of 500 Hertz. For comparison, an AM signal
occupies about 10,000 Hertz of bandwidth and therefore requires more transmission power.
And a single side-band signal (SSB) about half that (5,000 Hertz).

I honestly can't remember exactly why I returned to amateur radio after 15 or so years
away from it. But I remember stumbling across some videos of operators doing a Parks
on the Air activation using a small radio powered by a 9 volt battery using CW. My son
was getting into Scouts and camping; I thought that it would be a lot of fun to bring
a radio camping and try it out myself.

## Setting goals

After I'd learned the alphabet, numbers and useful punctuation I asked myself, "What's next?" How
good do I need to be at Morse code recognition to try and get on the air and do it for real? I
set a personal goal of being able to decode call signs at 25 WPM. When I do that, I thought, I'll
be ready to get on the air and operate CW.

About two weeks ago, I achieved 25 WPM call sign decoding on the Learn CW Online website.

I purchased a [straight key from cwmorse.us](https://cwmorse.us/collections/camel-back-keys). When it
arrived, I connected it to my Xiegu G90 and got on the air.

## Taking the leap

Operating CW on the air is a lot more difficult than simulated drills. The tones aren't as crisp and clear;
you're hearing them amidst static, operators send in varying cadences and my brain has a hard time
keeping up with a constant stream of code with no breaks. Although I can achieve a decode speed of above
20 WPM in simulations, I am probably operating between 10 and 15 WPM over the air.

Everyone has to start somewhere. I couldn't do drills forever and many friends online were encouraging me to 
just begin.

I have mainly focused on hunting Parks on the Air (POTA) activators because the exchange for this style of contact
is very quick and formulaic. Also, I can use the POTA website to learn their call sign ahead of time. This means
that I can tune into their frequency, listen for their announcement and verify their call sign. Then I only need to
respond with my own call sign, my state and provide a signal report.

I've been using the following "formula" as a CW POTA hunter:

    Activator: CQ CQ CQ POTA [their call]
    Hunter (me): W1YTQ
    Activator: W1YTQ TU 599
    Hunter (me): TU 599 MA 73 (my state)
    Activator: TU FER [their state/location] 73 QRC [their call]

As you can see from the quick exchange above, I only need to provide my own call sign, a signal report an my state of MA. 
The formula varies a bit but POTA CW activations are short and the POTA site provides a lot of info up front to help me along.

### First confirmed CW QSO

A POTA hunter, KG8SO, finally confirmed a QSO with me from Hillcrest State Gameland in Michigan.

Seeing a hunter's POTA log with my call sign as a CW contact was better than any award. I have a long way to go but that
first contact is the culmination of about a year of learning CW alone.

I know that my CW operation is slow and rough. But I'd reached the point where I needed to just start. I have so much to 
learn in this space. I need to be patient with myself because I've made a lot of mistakes.

## My history with CW

Back when I first got my amateur radio ticket in 1992 (a Novice license) as KA1ZPR, 
a minimum 5 words per minute morse code
test was required. I listened to some cassette tapes that played dots and dashes then spoke a letter.
I think I barely made the requirement. Then I never thought about code again. I focused on VHF operations
in FM mode.

I don't remember ever seeing my grandfather, [Fred Bean]({% link _sections/W1YTQ.md %}), operate CW. He
must have been pretty good at it given his time in the Army's Signal Corps.

## Learning Morse code today

In late 2022, about this time last year, I began learning Morse code again. It's much easier now than
when I was first learning at the age of 18, thirty years ago. Rather than cassette tapes you can 
use mobile applications and online resources. Three resources that I used were:

  - [Morse Mania](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.countrymania.morse) : I recommend this mobile app to start because it teaches morse code
  - [Morse Machine](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iu4apc.morsemachine) : I still use this mobile app to drill myself and improve my individual letter recognition
  - [LCWO (Learn CW Online)](https://lcwo.net/) : An internet site I use for advanced drills like call-sign decoding
