# Philmont Scout Ranch, Summer of 2025


![](PXL_20250719_132606529.jpg)

In July of 2025, I went on a 12 day trek to Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico with my son's Venture Crew. Here are
some of the photos we took during out trip.

Some photos were taken with a disposable camera so that I could save battery on my phone.

The mountain ranges we were hiking in have a July monsoon season. So the semi-arid climate was bursting with beauty.

This is Josh and me on top of Mt Phillips, our highest climb of the trek.

We hiked 61 miles over 12 days at elevations between 7,000 and 11,000 feet.
