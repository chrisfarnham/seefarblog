# Philmont Scout Ranch, Summer of 2025

![](PXL_20250719_132606529.jpg)

In July of 2025, our crew took on the 12-12 Rugged trek, a 60-mile journey through the mountains and history of Philmont Scout Ranch. Starting at Zastrow Trailhead, we trained with our Ranger before heading deep into the backcountry. Along the way, we experienced a balance of challenging hikes, rich program activities, and unforgettable scenery.

Here are some of the photos we took during our trip.

The mountain ranges we were hiking in have a July monsoon season. So the semi-arid climate was bursting with beauty.

This was our itinerary for our trek.

We hiked 61 miles over 12 days at elevations between 7,000 and 11,000 feet.

## Abreu

This photo shows the Tooth of Time over Carson Meadows. In nine days we would be watching
the sun rise from the top of the Tooth itself.

## A bear!

Between Carson Meadows and Fish Camp we we ran into this bear. Josh was in the front of the crew so he got a good photo of it with his disposable camera.

## Crooked Creek

## Comanche Peak

On the way to Mt Phillips (see the photo of Josh and me above) we stopped at
Clear Creek and shot some black powder rifles.

Then we had our longest hike and highest elevation of the trek. Because Comanche Peak was a dry
campsite with no water. I was carring 8 liters of water in my pack (~ 55 lbs).

That evening when we pulled into our site I had just enough energy to pitch my tent and get in bed.

## Beaubien

A highlight of our trip was Beaubien ranch where we were able to do some horseback riding.
