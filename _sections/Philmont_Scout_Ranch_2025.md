# Philmont Scout Ranch, Summer of 2025


![](PXL_20250719_132606529.jpg)

In July of 2025, I went on a 12 day trek to Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico with my son's Venture Crew. Here are
some of the photos we took during out trip.

Some photos were taken with a disposable camera so that I could save battery on my phone.

The mountain ranges we were hiking in have a July monsoon season. So the semi-arid climate was bursting with beauty.

This is Josh and me on top of Mt Phillips, our highest climb of the trek.
