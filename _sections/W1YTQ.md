# W1YTQ - my grandfather's call sign 

![](fred_bean_military.png)

My call sign, [W1YTQ](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1YTQ), first belonged to my grandfather [Fred William Bean](https://obituaries.bangordailynews.com/obituary/fred-bean-803788851). I applied
for and inherited his call sign on January 21, 2022.

Fred served his country as an officer in the US Army Signal Corps from 1942-1946. He was assigned to communication/cryptographic work in Burma and India. He continued with the Military Affiliate Radio Systems (MARS) until he retired as a US Army Captain in 1988.

> My interest in amateur radio was sparked by my grandfather Fred Bean

I was lucky enough to spend a lot of time with my grandfather at a young age and those memories include the 
constant sound of radios and scanners in the background. Amateur radio was the social network before social networks. He was active in his local club and always had friends reaching out to him
over the air.

My grandfather was a man of many talents. He was a high school industrial arts teacher by profession. He printed his own QSL cards from an illustrated plate of his own design and manufacture. As you can see he was a fairly good artist. 
If another radio operator made an HF contact with Fred Bean, he would stamp out a new card and send it to them in the mail. 

I've mounted the stamp plate and a card in a frame for display.

Many of my memories or him are working on his farm. We'd spend many hot summer days
haying his fields.
