# POTA Activation at the Charles River State Reserve

On a Friday afternoon in July I activated the [Charles River State Reserve](https://www.mass.gov/locations/charles-river-reservation). This park
stretches for 20 miles along the Charles River waterway from Boston upriver to Newton. There are several spots I could have activated but I decided to 
head into Allston near the Harvard Campus with my [Elecraft KH1 Transceiver](https://elecraft.com/products/kh1-transceiver)

Above is a view of my chosen spot off of Soldiers Field Road. I sat down in a folding camp chair with my KH1 and spent a pleasant afternoon sending Morse code.

This section of the Charles River has lots of activity. As you can see there were  lots of geese and boaters enjoying the space.

The KH1 with the whip served nicely. You can see a map of the contacts I made above.
