# POTA at the Middlesex Fells State Reserve

This morning during my son's baseball practice I had about 90 minutes to myself. I decided to head to 
[POTA site US-8414, Middlesex Fells State Reserve](https://pota.app/#/park/US-8414) to do a quick activation.

I had a relaxing morning, sipping my coffee and keying Morse Code on my 
[Elecraft KH1 transceiver]({% link _sections/New_KH1_Elecraft_HF_Radio.md %}).

I knew that it would be an easy activation once I saw that a beacon in New Zealand picked me up
on the [Reverse Beacon Network (RBN)](https://www.reversebeacon.net/main.php). While I didn't make any two-way POTA contacts
outside of the US I took the RBN pickup as a good omen.

## My setup

I used my usual car activation POTA setup:

 - KH1 Transceiver
 - Kit made [QBV 40/20-10 switchable antenna]({% link _sections/QBV_Antenna_Kit.md %})
    - Mounted on my SUV's rack with a [C-Clamp](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075WP3H58)
 - Paper logging (as I always do in the field)
 - A good strong mug of homemade coffee

My antenna has served me well over the winter since I made it. The screw attaching it to the bottom bracket has become loose
so I'll have to dissassemble it to tighten it up.

## Quick work to activate the POTA site

In the 90 minutes I had, I was able to make pretty relaxed and quick work. I've had bigger pile-ups but the
thing that I love about POTA is that it's not a contest, as an activator I control the pace.

So I relaxed with my coffee and took calls as they rolled in. I waited a bit between CQ calls enjoying my morning.

I started on 20 meters but once contacts slowed down I switched my antenna up to 40m and kept going. This allowed
me to get some local friends, like 
[Desmond (WK1V)]({% link _sections/POTA_with_Friends.md %}),
added to my activation's log.
