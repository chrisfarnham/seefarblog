# Jamboree on the Air and Support Your Parks Weekend

The third weekend of October is always a busy one for amateur radio. We had Jamboree on the Air (JOTA) 2025
as well as "Support your Parks Weekend" for Parks on the Air (POTA).

## Jamboree on the Air

![](JOTA-logo_Brea-Baygents.png){: .image-left }

[Jamboree-on-the-Air](https://www.scouting.org/international/jota-joti/jota/), or JOTA, is the largest Scouting event in the world. It is held annually the third full weekend in October. JOTA uses amateur radio to link Scouts and hams around the world, around the nation, and in your own community. This jamboree requires no travel, other than to a nearby amateur radio operator’s ham shack. Many times you can find the hams will come to you by setting up a station at your Scout camporee, at the park down the block, or perhaps at a ham shack already set up at your council’s camp. [^1]

Our troop, [Troop 119 in Lexington, MA](https://www.troop119.com/), had our October campout at
Camp Resolute in Bolton, MA.

JOTA wasn't the only activity - the Scouts were busy working on requirements such as knife and axe safety, working on Environmental Science Merit Badge by going on a nature hike and cooking their meals.

This is my third JOTA event with the troop and I will usually set up my station and during downtime
in their schedule I'll bring interested Scouts over to get on the radio.

As you can see, although most of my radio operations are using CW (Morse Code) I operate single side-band with the Scouts.

This Scout has his Technicians Amateur Radio License and has HF privileges for 10 meters. So he was able to operate my station using his own call sign.

Here are the we contacts made during Troop 119's JOTA event.

## Support your Parks Weekend

Parks on the Air's Support Your Parks weekends happen four times a year, one weekend each season.
Since it was a beatiful Fall weekend and radio propogation was good I decided to
head to [US-8400, Beaver Brook State Reserve](https://pota.app/#/park/US-8400) on Sunday after
returning home from camping.

Here's the certificate earned by activating that weekend.

Propogation was good - I operated on 20, 15 and 10 meters. My favorite POTA antenna's height[^2] can
be adjusted to be resonant on any band between 10 and 20 meters. A resonant antenna with a low
takeoff angle seems to really help, especially on the higher bands.
