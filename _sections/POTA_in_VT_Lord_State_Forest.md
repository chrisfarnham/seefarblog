# A quick, apres ski, POTA activation of Lord State Forest in VT

After skiing Killington on a beautiful winter Vermont day. I went out for a quick POTA activation.

Lord State Forest if 15 minutes from where we were staying in Reading, VT. My daughter, Layla, was relaxing and doing some
schoolwork. There was about an hour of daylight left. So I decided to get a quick activation in.

My rig for this activation was the same as my last one:
 - [Elecraft KH1]({% link _sections/New_KH1_Elecraft_HF_Radio.md %})
 - [QBV 40/20 antenna]({% link _sections/QBV_Antenna_Kit.md %})
 - [Camera clamp](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075WP3H58) (clamped to the roof rack of my Highlander)

This setup is quickly becoming a Winter favorite for me. I sit in my Highlander with the KH1 in my lap.

Here's a map of the contacts I made during the activation.

Propagation was pretty good that day. I was able to get 23 contacts in about 40 minutes of operation. Here's
a map of the [Reverse Beacon Network](https://www.reversebeacon.net/) data.

## First Vermont activation

This is my first activation in Vermont. I find myself in Vermont fairly frequently for skiing and visiting friends.
Easy to setup rigs like the KH1 and my new QBV 40/20 antenna allow me to get in some quick, easy radio fun in
as well.
