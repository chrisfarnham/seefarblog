# POTA at Alewife Brook State Reserve

![](PXL_20240619_121551103.jpg){: .image-left width="200px" }

This June 2024, we're dealing with a heat advisory across the East Coast of the US. I took Daisy out early in the morning to avoid the heat, but she wasn't having it.

Just days before, I took delivery of [my new KH1 Elecraft Transceiver]({% link _sections/New_KH1_Elecraft_HF_Radio.md %}), and I was looking forward to a solid attempt at a [Parks on the Air](https://parksontheair.com/) activation with it.

Is there a park nearby with a lot of shade so I can beat the heat? Five miles away (a 15-minute drive) is the [Alewife Brook Parkway State Reserve](https://pota.app/#/park/US-8399). In *the days before COVID*, my daily commute to Kendall Sq. in Cambridge went through this park.

## A Little Gem of a Semi-Urban Park

The Alewife Brook Parkway State Reserve is a little gem of a semi-urban park that I had never activated because I wasn't sure where I could set up an antenna without bothering other park-goers. The KH1's pedestrian portable capabilities are well-suited, so I decided to head there and find some shade.

Off of Acorn Park Drive, there is a DCR[^1] parking lot accessing a well-shaded and serene area with ponds, walking paths, and picnic tables. Exactly what I needed.

[^1]: DCR stands for [Department of Conservation and Recreation](https://www.mass.gov/orgs/department-of-conservation-recreation), a Massachusetts government department.

I went there after work and set up my KH1 with the right-angle antenna adapter, [SP4 CW Morse Double Paddle](https://cwmorse.us/products/sp4-sota-pota-cw-morse-magnetic-paddle-by-n0sa), and [Sony earbuds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IJXBX74).

I can't say that HF propagation was the best. The contacts were not piling up but they were coming in every few minutes. I am glad I learned to use the KH1's CW message memory with auto-repeat. The keyer memory did the work while I enjoyed the wildlife.

I enjoyed myself so much that I went back the next afternoon and activated the same park again. Above is a map of the contacts that I made over two days at the park. One QSO was 2,082 miles from Massachusetts to Utahâ€”pretty good for a 5-watt radio with a little antenna. Morse code gets it done!
