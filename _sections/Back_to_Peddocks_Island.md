# Back to Peddocks Island

This past weekend, September 13 and 14, 2025, I camped in Peddocks Island with my son's Scout Troop,
Troop 119, Lexington.

Our Peddocks Island trip is always a lot of fun and a great way to kick off our Scouting year. We
begin in Charlestown shipyard and cruise through Boston Harbor south to Hingham Bay.

I brought along radio equipment to enjoy some radio operations with the Scouts. Last
year we got a lot of Scouts on the air. ([2024 Peddocks Island Trip]({% link _sections/Back_to_Peddocks_Island.md %}))

> Interference from a nearby broadcast AM station prevented me from using by G90 for SSB with the Scouts

This year was a bit of a bust. When I set up my Rybakov antenna and turned on my G90 radio all I could
hear was a local AM radio station. No matter what frequency or band I tuned the G90 to, I would
pick up the nearby AM broadcast station.

I may build an [AM broadcast band pass filter](https://vk3il.net/projects/broadcast-band-filter/) to fix the issue. I've also
been thinking that I may purchase a Yaesu FT-891. I could get more power with SSB modes that the Scouts would enjoy.

When I wasn't working with the Scouts I was able to do a little Morse Code radio operations. Here
is a map of the contacts that I made over the weekend.

Sweden (3,644 miles away) was my longest contact. I made this using my 5 watt KH1 transceiver with [my Rybakov antenna]({% link _sections/Rybakov_Antenna.md %}).

I found some time as the UTC day changed over to do some POTA while looking across the water onto Hull, MA.
I put my headlamp into my Pelican case to diffuse the light onto my notebook, Nameless Key and KH1 radio.
