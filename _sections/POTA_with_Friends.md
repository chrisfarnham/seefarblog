# POTA with Friends

Today I met some new friends and we activated Great Brook Farm State Park in Massachusetts together.

After a long time away, I decided to pop into the [Long Island CW Club](https://longislandcwclub.org/)
Slow Speed Test session. The K1USN Slow Speed Test takes place on the air every Sunday evening and is a lot
of fun. I recommend it for all CW operators. If you'd like to learn more, I wrote a post about the K1USN SST
in an [earlier journal entry]({% link _sections/CW_SST_activity.md %}).

While in the LICW Zoom gathering, where we chat with each other while making CW contacts on the air and
help new operators get their first SST contacts I met Michelle, KC1UML, who lives nearby. We learned that
we activate many of the same POTA parks and set an intention to get together soon.

## POTA at Great Brook Farm State Park, US-2435

The next weekend on a gorgeous Saturday Fall morning I went out to meet Michelle and operate radio
together at [Great Brook Farm State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-2435). Desmond, WK1V, and Adam, AA1N, were
there as well.

I set up my [Xeigu G90](https://www.radioddity.com/products/xiegu-g90-hf-transceiver) with my 
[ground spike mounted vertical whip]({% link _sections/HomebrewQuarterWaveVertical.md %}) and Michelle
set out to activate the park.

While Michelle was activating with CW, Desmond and I helped Adam set up his mast and dipole antenna nearby. He began
operating on 10 meters so he wouldn't interfere with Michelle on 20 meters.

## First POTA Activation

Desmond remarked that he hadn't activated a park yet. He was next on G90 radio and activated his first POTA park.
I helped by keeping the log and so that he could focus on the key and radio.

Desmond did great. Activating a park for the first time is intimidating and an accomplishment. I
enjoyed being a small part of his first activation.

## Better with friends

Whatever your hobby, get out there and enjoy it with your people. You won't regret it. I'm glad that I joined
the Long Island CW Slow Speed Test session to enjoy their company and meet Michelle.

And I'm so thankful that Michelle invited me out on a beautiful day to activate Great Brook Farm and
make some new friends to enjoy and discuss our wonderful hobby.
