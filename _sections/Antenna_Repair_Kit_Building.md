# Antenna Repair and Kit Building

Two weekends ago the weather was rainy and [ham radio propagation](https://solar.w5mmw.net/) was poor.

On days like these, what is an amateur radio operator to do?

I pulled out my soldering iron and built an
[Elecraft dummy load and RF detector](https://elecraft.com/products/dl2-dummy-load-kit). I'm a beginner
builder and recommend this kit for anyone getting started in the building aspect of the hobby.

The instructions are a single page.

The PVC board doesn't have the components packed too tightly so a beginner solderer like me can
work with confidence.

You're basically soldering on 8 resisters.

Here's the completed device.

I was able to use it to test my KH1's ATU and transimission across all of its bands. And I was able to use a multimeter to
see voltage as I transmit into the dummy load.

## Repairing my switched antenna

Last December I build a [QBV 40/20-10 Switched Portable Antenna]({% link _sections/QBV_Antenna_Kit.md %}). I learned
a lot from building it and used it as my winter POTA kit. I would park and mount the antenna on the rack of my SUV
and operate from the warmth of my vehicle.

Over many POTA activations the bolt attaching the BNC connectors came loose and I was unable to attach my feedline.

One of the great things about making your own equipment is that when it breaks you know how to repair it.

It took me all of 10 minutes to detach the end-cap, tighten the internal bolt and resolder the coil wire.

Good as new.

> When you build your own equipment you also know how to repair it.

## Going forward

I have a few other projects on my workbench so you can look here for future entries.

Learning to solder and do basic repairs has been good fun and increased my knowledge of how
my equipment works.
