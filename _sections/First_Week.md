# First five days of HF operation

I've been able to get down to my radio station a few nights since that [first contact]({% link _sections/First_Contact.md %}).

I do a lot of listening and learning. But I do try to make at least one contact per session.

The map above was made by exporting my logs from [qrz.com](https://www.qrz.com/) and then I used the [ADIF to Map](https://www.levinecentral.com/adif2map/) tool.

Here is my logbook

Most of my contacts were made over 40 meters. I'm definitely becoming more comfortable with the radio
and learning how to operate it better.
