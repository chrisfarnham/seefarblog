# First SOTA Activation

Last Saturday, October 19, 2024, I completed my first Summits on the Air (SOTA) activation on [Mt. Monadnock](https://www.nhstateparks.org/find-parks-trails/monadnock-state-park). Mt. Monadnock, in southern NH, is a  3,165 foot climb and is one of of the most visited mountains in the world.

A first SOTA activation was one of my [2024 Radio Goals]({% link _sections/Radio_Goals.md %}). 
My son's Scout Troop had a Venture outing to Mt. Monadnock's summit as a 
practice hike for a [Philmont](https://www.philmontscoutranch.org/) trip scheduled next summer.

This Scouting trip was my opportunity to activate a summit for the first time.

In the photo below you can see me and Lexington's Venture crew on our way
to the summit with 25 lb packs as a practice for our summer trek in New Mexico.

## Summits on the Air

[Summits on the Air (SOTA)](https://www.sota.org.uk/) is an amateur radio activity that promotes portable operation from mountainous areas. Activators climb designated summits and operate their radio equipment from these locations. To successfully activate a summit, operators make at least four contacts with other radio operators from within the activation zone of the peak.

I've been doing a lot of Parks on the Air (POTA) this past year. The SOTA program predates POTA. SOTA is arguably more popular gobally
and is a little more challenging.

### KH1 - built for SOTA

If there was ever a radio built for SOTA it was my [KH1 radio]({% link _sections/New_KH1_Elecraft_HF_Radio.md %}). The KH1 is about the size of a Walkman and is a Morse code only radio with a power output of 5 watts.
I secured my the radio in a [Tufteln modified Pelican case](https://tufteln.com/products/modified-pelican-m40-for-kh1) to keep it safe in my pack and ready for the activation.

I didn't have a lot of time to take photos at the summit. The Venture crew had a schedule to keep; I needed to get
right to work. Once we got to the top, I took out my KH1 and began calling CQ - I had recorded CQ POTA message in 
the KH1's memory banks beforehand. I also recorded a message relaying the summit's reference number
[W1/HA-009](https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/summit/W1/HA-009)

### Busy airwaves

When I got onto 20 meters and scanned for a free frequency, the band was packed. 
That weekend was the [New York QSO Party](https://nyqp.org/wordpress/) as well was [Scouting's, Jamboree on
the Air](https://www.scouting.org/international/jota-joti/jota/). So it was difficult to find an open
frequency on the band. 

Before embarking on our hike, I set up a watch on the [SOTA Watch website](https://sotawatch.sota.org.uk/en/). If
you set up a watch then when you start calling CQ with Mores Code then the 
[Reverse Beacon Network](https://www.reversebeacon.net/main.php), a network of stations listening to the bands and reporting what stations they hear, when and how well, will report your signal and list you on the 
[SOTA Spots page](https://sotl.as/spots/sotawatch) so that "chasers" can contact you.

### 5 watts can go the distance

Here's  screenshot of SOTAwatch on my phone.

Here's a screenshot of the reverse beacon network from my session on the mountain. 
5 watts at 30 decibels over 890 miles is amazing.

> What can the KH1 and Morse code on a mountain summit do with 5 watts? How about 890 miles received at 30 decibels?

## Four contacts for the win

I had about 30 minutes to make four contacts to officially activate 
[Mt. Monadnock, SOTA reference W1/HA-009](https://www.sotadata.org.uk/en/summit/W1/HA-009). And
I was just able to do it. I found an open frequency and made four quick contacts. I tried to get
more, just in case a "busted" a call sign and misheard one. But four was all I was able to get
and four was all I needed for a successful activation.

Two contacts were a husband and wife team in Kansas City, one contact was activating a POTA park
in Canada and my fourth contact was a New Hampshire local.

> Thank you to all of the "chasers" who answered my call and helped me activate Mt. Monadnock

Here's my log from the activation. My handwriting is awful when I have a stable surface so don't blame
the KH1 logging tray for my horrible penmanship.

## Moving forward with SOTA

Mt Monadnock is beautiful. I highly recommend the trip. I look forward to many more SOTA activations.

This summer I'll be hiking with my son in Philmont. I'll be bringing my KH1 radio with me. 
Although Philmot isn't a
SOTA or POTA site. I hope that I'll connect with you on the airwaves.
