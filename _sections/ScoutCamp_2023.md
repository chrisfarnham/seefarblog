# Summer Scout Camp

I was an adult leader for my son Josh's Scout Troop during their summer at 
[Hidden Valley Scout Camp](https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/summer-camp/)
in Gilmanton, NH. I set up a field radio to demonstrate radio operations to the 40 or so co-ed Scouts in [Troop 119, Lexington](http://www.troop119.com/).

From the radio station set up at the troop's campsite we made 47 two-way contacts to 6 different countries. Our most distant contact was from NH to Italy, 6,569 km.

I didn't schedule specific radio learning sessions. I operated the radio in the camp site as I 
usually would. Curious Scouts would come by and ask questions about what I was doing.

We operated from Monday until Friday. In the last two days, I was usually operating with a couple Scouts sitting with me and helping me operate the radio.

I think we got some Scouts hooked. In the Fall we'll be offering the Radio Merit Badge and I think we'll have a strong turnout. The radio operators on the other end were really generous with their time and were patient as the Scouts talked on the air.

The Scouts learned about radio science and the hobby of amateur radio.
