# Summer Scout Camp

I was an adult leader for my son Josh's Scout Troop during their summer at 
[Hidden Valley Scout Camp](https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/summer-camp/)
in Gilmanton, NH. I set up a field radio to demonstrate radio operations to the 40 or so co-ed Scouts in [Troop 119, Lexington](http://www.troop119.com/).

From the radio station set up at the troop's campsite we made 47 two-way contacts to 6 different countries. Our most distant contact was from NH to Italy, 6,569 km.

Over 5 days, I operated the radio in the camp site as I and curious Scouts would come by and ask questions about what I was doing.

On Wednesday, I was able set up a pre-arranged contact with [W1TEN](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1TEN), another Scout
Leader in NH. W1TEN was operating about 44 miles away as the crow flies from our campsite. Such a close distance 
meant that we would have to rely on *ground wave propogation* rather than *sky wave propogation* which is less
predictable. Would it work?

It worked fine! Greg, myself and a few Scouts from our Troop chatted with Greg and learned about
amateur radio together. We were joined by [N1ATE](https://www.qrz.com/db/N1ATE), Nathan, who was
the Radio Merit Badge Counselor at Hidden Valley.

Greg had recently worked as a volunteer for [K2BSA, Radio Scouting](https://k2bsa.net/2023/07/the-road-to-the-2023-national-scout-jamboree/) at the 2023 National Scout Jamboree at The Summit Bechtel Reserve in West Virginia. He was well practiced in working with Scouts over the radio and conversing with them on the air.

We operated from Monday until Friday. In the last two days, I was usually operating with a couple Scouts sitting with me and helping me by copying into my log book or adjusting the VFO knob.

I think we got some Scouts hooked. In the Fall we'll be offering the Radio Merit Badge and I think we'll have a strong turnout. The radio operators on the other end were really generous with their time and were patient as the Scouts talked on the air.
