# Summer Scout Camp

I was an adult leader for my son Josh's Scout Troop during their summer at 
[Hidden Valley Scout Camp](https://nhscouting.org/outdoor-programs/summer-camp/)
in Gilmanton, NH. I set up a field radio to introduce amateur radio to the 40 or so co-ed Scouts in [Troop 119, Lexington](http://www.troop119.com/).

From our troop's campsite we made 47 two-way contacts to 6 different countries. Our most distant contact was from NH to Italy, 6,569 km.

Most afternoons during the week, I operated the radio in the camp site. Curious Scouts would come by to ask questions about what I was doing.

On Wednesday, I was able set up a pre-arranged contact with [W1TEN](https://www.qrz.com/db/W1TEN), Greg who is
another Scout Leader in NH.

W1TEN was operating about 44 miles away from our campsite. Such a close distance for High Frequency bands 
meant that we would have to rely on *ground wave propagation* rather than *sky wave propagation* which is less
predictable. Would it work? Would Greg's station be in our radio's skip zone?

It worked fine! Greg, some Scouts and I talked and learned about
amateur radio together. We were joined by [N1ATE](https://www.qrz.com/db/N1ATE), Nathan, who was
the Radio Merit Badge Counselor at Hidden Valley.

Greg had recently worked as a volunteer for [K2BSA, Radio Scouting](https://k2bsa.net/2023/07/the-road-to-the-2023-national-scout-jamboree/) at the 2023 National Scout Jamboree at The Summit Bechtel Reserve in West Virginia. He was well practiced in working with Scouts over the radio and conversing with them on the air.

We operated for a few hours in the afternoon over the rest of the week. We had rain the last two days and I was usually operating with a couple Scouts sitting with me and helping by copying into the log book or adjusting the VFO knob.

I think we got some Scouts hooked. In the Fall we'll be offering the Radio Merit Badge and I think we'll have a strong turnout. The radio operators on the other end were really generous with their time and were patient as the Scouts talked on the air.
