# Feed-line pass-through and grounding

I recently cut a pass through and assembled a lightning protection and grounding solution for my 
home radio station. My station is in the finished portion of my basement. My foundation walls
are high and extend about 3 feet above grade. The plan was to drill a large hole through
the foundation wall into an electric utility closet that sits next to where I operate.

Step one was reach out to my friend Ken who knows a ton more than I do about construction and 
had a drill that could penetrate cement.
