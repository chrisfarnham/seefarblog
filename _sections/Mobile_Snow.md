# First time mobile in the snow

![](camp_bell_remote_radio_station.png)

This past weekend I went camping with my son's Scout troop in Gilmanton, NH. 
The Scouts were working on their Wilderness Survival merit badge and were
planning to sleep in improvized snow shelters.

I used this as an opportunity to take my Xiegu G90 into the field
for the first time. 

I added these items to my current kit to go mobile:
 - [LiFePo4 battery](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Q7FY8CC)
 - [Battery meter](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RQP6HHN)
 - [Kidaroo backpack](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GZNVVJW)
 - Standard power wires and Anderson connectors

Here's my radio setup with snow huts being built in the background.

> a sunny and mild day. Great weather to be outside.

I swear that I was enjoying myself. I was very focused when I took this selfie.

I operated for about 2 hours and made seven contacts. I'm still learning my radio and
did a lot of listening.

The noise floor at my suburban home is usually around an S3. Here in the wilderness of NH
it was basically at zero.

I was hearing transmissions from
UK and Germany clearly but the pile-up was too great and I moved onto other bands
rather than queue up and break in.

Here's a photo of the antenna from the radio setup. I used an arbor line to
get my EFRL antenna about 30 feet into a tree and set it up in a sloper configuration.
