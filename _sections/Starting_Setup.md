# First amateur radio rig

![Simple diagram of component chain. Operator -> Radio -> Jumper -> choke -> 15 foot feedline -> 9:1 unun -> end fed random wire antenna](first_rig_diagram.png "Component Chain")

Last month I began assembling gear to start HF operation. The gear required to start
HF operation for the first time can be difficult to discern. I found 
[Dave Casler's Reference Station](https://dcasler.com/reference/) helpful.

Using Dave's reference for HF as a starting point I created my own list and shared it
with [the Ham Radio Crash Cource Discord chat](https://discord.com/invite/YGTJx8E) for comment. Thanks to everyone on HRCC discord who 
provided useful suggestions on my “Zero to HF Hero” list.

A new Xiegu G90 was delivered today. I will try to get on the air with a random wire antenna. So added an LDG 9:1 unun and a spool of wire. 

## List of equipment to go from Zero to HF Hero
 - Xiegu G90
 - Samlex Desktop Switching Power Supplies SEC-1235M

The items above were ordered through Radio Oddity, DXEngineering and Amazon. 

Note that in the picture above you can also see an [arborist throw line](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074CK8LPP). I needed some way to get my antenna lifted into a tree
on my property.
