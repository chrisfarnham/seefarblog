# First Amateur Radio Rig

![Simple diagram of component chain. Operator -> Radio -> Jumper -> choke -> 15 foot feedline -> 9:1 unun -> end fed random wire antenna](first_rig_diagram.png "Component Chain")

Last month I earned my General license. Yesterday, I ordered all the gear to begin HF operation. Thanks to everyone on the HRCC discord who commented on my “Zero to HF Hero” list of items to ensure I have what I need to get on the air.


A new Xiegu G90 was delivered today. I will try to get on the air with a random wire antenna. So added an LDG 9:1 unun and a spool of wire.
