# Journal entry rollup
{: .no_toc }

This site is almost two and a half years old now. This entry is "journal roll-up" that
acts as an overall guide. It summarizes and categorizes all my journal entries to date.[^1]

[^1]: The categories and page links on this page were generated
    using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). AI is good at summarizing and
    categorizing collections of documents. All other pages on this site and
    the introduction on this page were written by me without AI assistance.

    I do use LLMs and AI periodically to check grammar and clean up markdown. When I use
    AI in a substantive way, I'll always mention it so you, the reader, knows.
