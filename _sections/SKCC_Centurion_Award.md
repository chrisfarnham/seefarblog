# Earning my Straight Key Century Club Centurion Award

Earlier this week I submitted my application to the [Straight Key Century Club (SKCC)](https://www.skccgroup.com/) 
and was awarded Centurion. 
This award is given to SKCC members who make contact with 100 other members and exchange SKCC their member numbers
and names.

The email announcing my achievment reads, "Chris Farnham, W1YTQ, SKCC# 27956, has achieved the coveted 1st generation
SKCC member achievement known far and wide as the Centurion Cx1 award."

## The Staight Key Century Club

According to the website, "The Straight Key Century Club is the most active group of mechanical-key Morse 
code radiotelegraph operators in the world. Founded in January 2006, we have thousands of members around the globe."
Members of this club make HF radio contacts using any of the three early original types of manual telegraph keys: 
Straight Key, Bug and Cootie.

I use a straight key.
