# Getting that first contact

All my equipment arrived and it was time to get on the air. I had a radio and power source to unbox.

And some transformers and a spool of wire to turn into an antenna.

## A truly compromised antenna

They say, just get some wire high up in the air and begin experimenting. So I got right to it.

I measured out 53 feet of wire as recommented by this article, "[The "Best" Random Wire Antenna Lengths](https://www.hamuniverse.com/randomwireantennalengths.html)". I threw a line into a tree using the arborist throw line I ordered and
used that to hang a loop of clothesline.

I tried some different configurations but settled on a rough inverted V shape from the basement window where my radio
is set up, to a tree 30 feet or so away and about 18 feet in the air and down to a neighbor's fence.

Then I added a 17 foot counterpoise that I run in the opposite direction inside my basement.

This antenna is about a basic and crude as it gets. And the feedthrough is just the light wire fed through a cracked window.

## Trial and error

Operating an HF radio isn't as simple as turing it on and selecting a frequency. For the first few days I listened, learning
to draw in and isolate a signal. It's my first radio so I can't compare but I am guessing that my radio, the G90, is 
somewhere in the middle in terms of ease of use. It has a lot of features for such a small radio.

The RF amp, volume, tuner, antenna matching unit and various filter controls all can be manipulated to draw in and isolate
a signal. I read the manual before starting but operating is another matter. It sook some time.

At one point I was having a hard time and then realized that I accidently put the radio into "split mode" where it was
receiving and transmitting on different frequencies. This means that the antenna matcher was confused and I was getting a
poor match across different frequency bands.

More reading, a firmware update and turning off "split" got me to a better place. I learned how to tune the radio and pull
in a signal.

## First contact

Finally I was comfortable and wanted to get on with it. An operator with a really strong signal from Virginia, 
[WU9P](https://www.qrz.com/db/Wu9p), called for contact on 40 meters.

Chuck was loud and clear - he reported the same
for my signal on his end. If you look at his profile page he definitely has a great antenna so he was able to pull in my lightweight 20 watt signal.

We exchanged call signs, talked about our radio setups and he coached me a little bit and wished me luck. Chuck was
friendly and welcoming.

## Next steps

I have a lot of ideas for antenna improvements and operating my radio when mobile. My first contact was fun and 
I'm looking forward to more.
