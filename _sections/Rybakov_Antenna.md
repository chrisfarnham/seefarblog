# I built a Rybakov Antenna for POTA

![](PXL_20240929_175059460.jpg){: width="500px"}

This past weekend (September 28 and 29, 2024) I built a Rybakov antenna to do
some Parks on the Air at
[Minute Man Historical National Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-0745)
and acheived great results.
I'll share how I built the antenna and show my results. I do have some questions about this antenna
and am hoping that some readers will reach out to me and share their thoughts.

Two amateur radio operators who have taught me a lot about antennas and radio operations are
[Tim G5TM](https://www.youtube.com/@timg5tm941) and [Walt K4OGO](https://www.youtube.com/@COASTALWAVESWIRES).
Both of them have recommended and built Rybakov antennas. I wanted to build one for myself and try it out.

## What is a Rybakov antenna?

The Rybakov is a vertical antenna about 25 feet in length with a 4 to 1 transformer. It isn't a resonant
antenna so it requires a matching unit (i.e., antenna tuner) to operate. I use a G90 radio with a great,
built-in matching unit so the Rybakov should work well for me.


## Building the antenna in the field

![](PXL_20240929_173351217.jpg){: width="400px"}

Here's what I used to construct the antenna:

 - A DX Commander Expedition pole (10 meters)
    - Augmented with pipe clamps with vinyl tubing
 - Some ground stakes
 - Yellow electrical tape
 - A 1 to 4 LDG Unun
 - Some inexpensive speaker wire
 - Some paracord

![](PXL_20240928_154035667.jpg){: width="200px"}

I measured and cut the wire to 25 feet.


![](PXL_20240929_173617912.jpg){: width="400px"}


I added
some pipe clamps (or jubilee clips) with vinyl tubes to protect the pole and better support
the vertical load. Then I secured it with paracord guylines. I pre-attached three short loops
to the top, third clamp so I can easily attach the guy lines.

Consider learning a few useful knots: 
[a square knot](https://www.animatedknots.com/square-knot),
[bowline](https://www.animatedknots.com/bowline-knot), 
[two-half hitches](https://www.animatedknots.com/two-half-hitches-knot) and 
[midshipmans hitch](https://www.animatedknots.com/midshipmans-hitch-knot) is all you need. You'll never
need to waste money on fancy rigging or hardware.

> If you learn a few useful knots you'll be able to rig your masts, antennas and guy lines without
> specialized hardware.

Here's a picture of a midshipmans hitch. This hitch is adjustable for tension to the guy stakes. I tie
two guy lines loosely while the mast is laying on the ground.
Then once the mast is lifted, I cinch them up and secure the final third line which keeps 
the mast in place.

Here's what the transformer and ground radial assembly at the bottom of the mast look like. 
I laid out four 13 foot radials, borrowed from my 
[spike mounted quarter-wave whip]({% link _sections/HomebrewQuarterWaveVertical.md %}) assembly.

Here you can see the guy lines, radials and the table where I was operating.

## Ready to activate

It was a beautiful weekend and I was ready to activate.

![](PXL_20240928_164944686.jpg){: width="500"} <!-- radio on table -->

I built this antenna two consecutive days, Saturday and Sunday. The second day
I built it I was able to get up and running much faster. Practice makes perfect.

On the first day I forgot my Morse code key so I operated voice in SSB mode.
On the second day I brought my key and operated Morse code (CW) only.

As usual I had a busy weekend with family activities. So between the two days
I was probably sitting down operating the radio for about two and a half hours.

Here are my CONUS (Continental United States) over those two days.

Here are my European contacts over the two days.

Both days I started on the 10 meter band and then ended my activation
on the 20 meters. Most of the long distance contacts 
(Belgium, France, Brazil, Mexico) were on 10 meters while the nearer contacts
(Ontario, Ohio, Georgia) were on 20. Radio waves are fickle and can surprise you. The
Italian contact was on 20 meters.

And I made one contact in Brazil.

Here's the view from my operating position. I had a nice chat with, Josh, one of the
rangers who often says, "Hello", while I'm working the radio.

And here's a photo from the parking lot. I had some cones from my youth coaching days
and decided to place them near my radials. There was not much traffic in that area
of the park. If it had been busy, I would have gone with a lower-profile setup like
[my KH1]({% link _sections/New_KH1_Elecraft_HF_Radio.md %}).

## Performance

As you can see from the map of contacts shown above, this antenna performs really well. 
I had a lot of fun building it and want to thank Walt and Tim for introducing me
to this style of antenna.

I took some readings with my Rig Expert antenna analyzer (which I'm still learning how to use).

![](PXL_20240929_193828794.jpg){: width="250"}  <!-- rig 10m -->

SWR at 10 meters looks great.

![](PXL_20240929_194217580.jpg){: width="250"}  <!-- rig 17m -->

An SWR of 4.5 at 17 meters is manageable.

![](PXL_20240929_193907695.jpg){: width="250"}  <!-- rig 20 m -->

The SWR at 20 meters doesn't look too good. My G90 was able to tune it up
and I made a ton of contacts on that band. If it works it works, I guess.

![](PXL_20240929_194145487.jpg){: width="250"}  <!-- rig 30m -->

SWR at 30 meters looks manageable as well. I took this reading just before I packed up out
of curiousity.

### Questions

I'd love to hear from others who've made a Rybakov antenna. What was your build like? What
was your SWR across different bands? What transformer did you use?

I felt like the SWR on 20 meters was higher than I expected. I'm pretty sure I cut the length
correctly at 25 feet. Should I add more radials?

These questions will inspire my future experiments.
