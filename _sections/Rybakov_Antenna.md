# I built a Rybakov Antenna for POTA

![](PXL_20240929_175059460.jpg){: width="500px"}

This past weekend (September 28 and 29, 2024) I built a Rybakov antenna and acheived great results.
I'll share how I built the antenna and show my results. I do have some questions about this antenna
and am hoping that some readers will reach out to me and share their thoughts.

Two amateur radio operators who have taught me a lot about antennas and radio operations are
[Tim G5TM](https://www.youtube.com/@timg5tm941) and [Walt K4OGO](https://www.youtube.com/@COASTALWAVESWIRES).
Both of them have recommended and built Rybakov antennas. I wanted to build one for myself and try it out.

## What is a Rybakov antenna

The Rybakov is a vertical antenna about 25 feet in length with a 4 to 1 transformer. It isn't a resonant
antenna so it requires a matching unit (i.e., antenna tuner) to operate. I use a G90 radio with a great,
built-in matching unit so the Rybakov should work well for me.

The photo above shows the antenna before I constructed it in the field. 

Supplies:

 - A DX Commander Expedition pole (10 meters)
    - Augmented with pipe clamps with vinyl tubing
 - Some ground stakes
 - Yellow electrical tape
 - A 1 to 4 LDG Unun
 - Some inexpensive speaker wire
 - Some paracord

I measured and cut the wire to 25 feet.

To secure the pole with paracord guylines and allow it to support the load, I added
some pipe clamps (or jubilee clips) with vinyl tubes to protect the pole.
