# My Grandfather's Military Radio Code Training Records (1942)

Earlier this summer I was gifted my grandfather's radio code training records that he used during his duties as an
Army Signal Corp officer. I was able to find these records on Discogs as [United States Armed Forces Institute, Special Service Division, S.O.S. War Department – Basic Radio Code (Records 13-22)](https://www.discogs.com/release/10342953-United-States-Armed-Forces-Institute-Special-Service-Division-SOS-War-Department-Basic-Radio-Code-Re).
This collection was published in 1942 under the Allied Record Manufacturing Co., Inc. label. I have the 2nd collection (records 13-22) which covers more advanced
radio code copying.

The recorded material consists of a code aptitude test, introduction to Morse Code letters and numbers, and training at various speeds up to 16 WPM. You can [find these records on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/U.S._Armed_Forces_Institute_Basic_Radio_Code_ca1942/) where they've been
digitized and are available for anyone to download and listen.

## More about my grandfather, Fred Bean

In a previous journal entry I wrote about [my grandfather Fred Bean and our shared call sign, W1YTQ]({% link _sections/W1YTQ.md %}). 
My grandfather's training records are another connection to him as I enjoy
amateur radio. The radio code records are especially meaningful because in the past year CW has become my primary
mode of radio operations. I really enjoy Morse code.

The gift of these records provides an excuse for me to write a little more about him. Here's an excerpt from a document my mother
submitted to a local publication, Paper Talks Magazine:
