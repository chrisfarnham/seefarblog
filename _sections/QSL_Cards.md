# My personal, custom printed QSL cards

This month, I designed and printed my own QSL cards — postcards that amateur radio operators 
exchange to confirm two-way contacts.

Over the past two years, I've received QSL cards from amateur operators worldwide. It's always a 
nice surprise to find them in the mailbox, especially in an age where personal mail is rare.

Here are some of the QSL cards that I've received. I wanted to return the favor and respond with my own
custom card.

## Designing my own card

I  began with a photo that captured me enjoying my radio hobby—a quick selfie taken last summer (2024) 
during a Parks on the Air activation at Minute Man National Park.

Despite my head being slightly cropped at the top, the photo had some things going for it:

 - My smile is natural, I look like I'm having fun
 - It has a depth of field with the radio in the foreground
 - It has my Elecraft KH1 - a favorite

Altogether it's clear I'm enjoying radio at a beautiful place on a beautiful day. A great start for
my QSL card.

My custom cards were ordered and printed by KB3IFH and they provide [excellent tips on the size, format and
design of your QSL card](https://storage.googleapis.com/wzukusers/user-34856890/documents/5bec64d367b74ca5b8dc1b5dd7ceb8fa/KB3IFH%20QSL%20Tips%20-%20Resolution%20-%20Bleed.pdf). I used [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) a free image editing program
to create my own card according to their instructions.

I started with a green base—after experimenting with colors for hours—then placed my photo 
on top. To create a clean, layered effect, I carefully removed the forest background behind my left 
shoulder to reveal the layer below it.
The green flat color provided a clean space on which I could superimpose text.

Since the photo's dimensions didn’t match a standard card, I extended the green layer to 
the right and added my region information, rotated 90 degrees.

The back of the card was designed by [KB3IFH QSL Cards](https://www.kb3ifhqslcards.com/). I selected from their
design options and gave them some information.

I wanted plenty of room to write a short message as well as
a form for information about our radio exchange. The back shows SKCC and LICW logos along with my personal membership numbers.

## My grandfather's QSL card hangs above my radio station

My grandfather, the original W1YTQ operator, had his own custom QSL cards, which I’ve proudly framed and 
hung above my radio station.

My journal entry, [My Grandfather's Call Sign]({% link _sections/W1YTQ.md %}) has a close-up of his original card and the printing plate for printing it.

## I'd love to send you a QSL card

If I’m in your logbook, feel free to reach out and request a QSL card. While I don’t plan to send one for every contact,
I’ll gladly send them to frequent contacts, anyone who sends me one, or for special events and operations.

I've sent them to my [LICW Slow Speed Test friends](_sections/CW_SST_activity.md), 
local operators I've met in person, my first SKCC contact and my 100th
SKCC contact to [earn my Centurion]({% link _sections/SKCC_Centurion_Award.md %}).

> I'll send my QSL card to every contact I make while hiking Philmont in New Mexico this July

Also, I intend to send one out to every contact I make this summer while hiking at Philmont in New Mexico.
