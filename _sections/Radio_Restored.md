# Radio restored

![](PXL_20241015_213244213.jpg)

In the Spring of this year (2024) I wrote a short post titled [Radio Interrupted]({% link _sections/Radio_Interrupted.md %}). The tree which was
acting as my antenna mast was cut down and I had no other options. I didn't have a working antenna for my home base station (i.e., QTH in radio lingo).
This was fine, I really leaned into field operations and have activated parks for [Parks on the Air](https://pota.app/#/profile/W1YTQ) 35 times so far this year.

But colder days are coming and I want to be inside operating my radio where it's warm.

## Antenna mast

I have no trees suitable to secure an antenna to and a suburban lot of 0.8 acres (3238 square meters). So my plan was to secure a mast to the side of
my house, convenient to my [feedline passthrough]({% link _sections/Feedline_Passthrough.md %}). I wanted to have it set up like a hoist or flag mast
with a cleat on the bottom so that I can easily experiment with different wire antennas.

I'm not keen on ladders and heights. I knew that if I tried to do this project myself I would likely do a poor job of it. Better to have a 
professional do it. I reached out to [New England Antenna](https://www.newenglandantenna.com/). Gary, the owner, chatted with me on the phone
and we came up with a plan. He did a great job installing exactly what I wanted, a simple mast and lanyard setup.

## 40 meter end-fed half-wave (EFHW)

Although I like building my own antennas, it seemed that my 1:49 unun transformer wasn't working properly. I've been too busy with work
and Scouting to build kits; I really just wanted to get on the air. So I went ahead and ordered a commercial antenna. The one that
I chose and am really happy with is an end-fed half-wave (EFHW) sold by [KO4FSZ](https://ko4fsz.com/). It is really well priced.
I took it out of the package and hoisted it up to begin using it right away. I didn't tune or trim the antenna at all.

I now have the 40, 20, 15 and 10 meter bands with a resonant antenna. At 64 feet, the antenna barely fits into my yard when
set up in an inverted V configuration.

## Onward

I haven't had a 40 meter antenna for a while. It's nice to get on a band that has good night-time propagation.

I'm excited that with my mast and lanyard setup I can experiment with different wire antennas. In the future I want to
build some monoband dipoles and some G5RV style antennas.
