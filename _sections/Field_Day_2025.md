# Field Day 2025 with the Penn Wireless Association

This past weekend, June 28th and 29th, was Amateur Radio Field Day. A big weekend for
our hobby. On Field Day, radio clubs and operators set up in public spaces to
practice emergency operations and share our radio hobby with the public.

That weekend I was traveling to visit my in-laws in Eastern Pennsylvania so was not able to participate in
field day with my local club in Massachusetts.

Between family activities I had a few hours and decided to check to to [Tyler State Park](https://pota.app/#/park/US-1430).
I figured I might do a Field Day POTA activation or run into other Field Day operators and say, "Hello."

Sure enough a local club, the [Penn Wireless Association (W3SK)](https://www.pennwireless.org/), were set up in the park.
I signed into their guest book and when they learned I was a visiting licensed operator they invited me to operate with
them.

I walked up to the CW station and was immediately welcomed by [Steve (W3SD)](https://www.qrz.com/db/W3SD) and [Roy (AA3RT)](https://www.qrz.com/db/AA3RT).
They invited me to operate their W3SK station. Morse code was coming in a little faster than I'm used to. Roy and Steve helped me decode transmissions
and coached me on the Field Day exchange. I really appreciate their help.

I spent about an hour chatting with Steve and Roy about life, radio and Morse Code. I'm thankful for their hospitality. It was a nice introduction
to Field Day which I'd never done before.
